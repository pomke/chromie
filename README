Licence: MIT

Chromie is a client side javascript library providing a Type 
system and MVC pattern designed to bring order to complex applications.

It aims to maintain some simple rules of sound programming 
which in turn maintain clear lines of abstraction.

Chromie is designed to work with any UI library and can easily
be retro-fitted, bringing order to existing applications, or used
from the outset to structure projects of any size.
